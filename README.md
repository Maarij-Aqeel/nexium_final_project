#  Intervue AI

## What I built (X)

I developed an **AI-powered Interview Practice Platform** where students can simulate technical interviews in real time. The platform provides a realistic interview experience, generates domain-specific questions, offers AI-driven feedback, and helps candidates assess and improve their performance. Additionally, it includes a developing **Company Portal**, enabling organizations to conduct structured interviews with selected candidates.
